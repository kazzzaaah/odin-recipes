# odin-recipes

First project in the The Odin Project. 
Utilizing basic intro html skills, along with practicing with git.

Reflection: I felt good using the skills I learned in the CP to making new directories, files, move files, rename files, organize my recipe directory, and using git to practice doing proper commits.
