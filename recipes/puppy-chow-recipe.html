        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Best Puppy Chow Recipe  (AKA: Muddy Buddies) EVER! Only 4 ingredients (no butter) and a few minutes results in an irresistible dessert loaded with chocolate and peanut butter! The perfect sweet treat to feed a crowd! </p>
       
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>6-7 cups Rice Chex Cereal</li>
            <li>1-2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt peanut butter and chocolate together, either on the stovetop or in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Next, add 3 cups of cereal to a large bowl. Pour 1 cup of your chocolate/peanut butter mixture over the cereal.</li>
            <li>Add 3 more cups of cereal to the bowl and then pour the rest of the chocolate/peanut butter mixture on top.</li>
            <li>Stir until the cereal is evenly coated. If there are pools of chocolate/peanut butter at the bottom of your bowl, add more cereal 1/4 cup at a time until all that deliciousness is coating your cereal. Remember we WANT clumps, so do NOT add too much cereal!</li>
            <li>Let the mixture cool slightly (I throw mine in the fridge or outside on my porch if itâ€™s cold out). You do not want it to harden!</li>
            <li>Once your mixture is at or below room temperature, add 1 cup of powdered sugar. Mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Let cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add more powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a time until your cereal is coated to your satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature, if it lasts more than 0.3 seconds.</li>
        </ol>
